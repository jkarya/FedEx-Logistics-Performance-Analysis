FedEx Logistics Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the global supply chain operations of FedEx Logistics, with the goal of uncovering insights that can optimize shipment processes, minimize freight costs, and improve delivery efficiency. The dataset contains detailed information about purchase orders, shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-specific details such as item descriptions and quantities. Through data analysis, this project aims to streamline the supply chain and enhance decision-making for cost-effective logistics management.

Business Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

To provide in-depth insights into freight costs across various shipment methods and countries.
To analyze vendor contributions to shipment quantities and total line item values.
To explore the relationship between shipment weight, item quantities, and freight cost for better budgeting and forecasting.
To identify bottlenecks or delays in the supply chain by analyzing delivery times and shipment performance.
